Simulation of an Amusement Park

The user inputs amount of customers, length of duration for each ride, capacity for each ride, line capacity for each ride, and simulation length.
The program will simulate the amusement park and then output statistics for the average amount of rides each type of customer has gone on and the amount of people that have completed each ride.
